# Traditional AI Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of traditional AI algorithms with practical examples.

- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**  
  Implements a Tic-Tac-Toe game where the player competes against the computer, using the Alpha-Beta pruning algorithm to optimize the computer's move.

- **Genetic Algorithm**  
  Implements a Genetic Algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem by identifying the shortest route between a set of cities.

- **Heuristic Algorithm**  
  Implements the Misplaced Tiles heuristic to solve the 8-puzzle problem using the A* search algorithm to determine the optimal sequence of moves to reach the goal state.
